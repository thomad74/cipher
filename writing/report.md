## Design
For this assignment, we wanted to make a program that focused on the art and
science of sending and decoding secret messages. To do this we investigated two
different forms of cryptography. The first was a form of Caesar Cipher, which
shifts each letter by an amount given by the key. The second type was a Vigenere
cipher, which uses a word as a key to determine the shift. We used similar set
ups as previous labs, but we altered it for strings. Following this we added
algorithms to perform these functions on a string.
