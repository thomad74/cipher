## Jordan's Reflection
This lab had it's difficulties. It was hard to implement the cipher in our
program because the input for our size was an integer and we were trying to
convert to a string. It was interesting in an topic though because we were able
to figure out how encrypting and decrypting works. The algorithms that we used
for our program were implemented with using simple for loops which I thought
was pretty cool. Overall, this lab challenged us because we took a concept that
we knew a little about but expanded on them. We were able to use time
complexities that we learned from previous labs showed how the two different
ciphers work and how their times differed from each other. I believe I have
learned useful information that I can go on and expand on.
