# Reflection by Dillon Thoma, Ben Watto, Robert Samuel, and Jordan Wilson

## Group Reflection
This lab required us to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
We were required to create two different types of cipher, Caesar and Vigenere,
and compare and contrast them using implementations and evaluations. It was
interesting to see the messages we would use be encrypted different ways, and
see the secret message that it would be changed to. There were many different
options for this project, but our group decided upon this one because we felt
it would be the most interesting, as well as challenge us to learn something.
During this project, we learned a lot about the real world application of Computer
Science. Throughout the lab we had many issues involving converting one type of
data to another, to solve this issue we had to change them all to one type to
avoid the errors. We also had to try and implement many different algorithms
before we created one that successful encrypted our messages. To ensure our
program was functioning correctly, we used the gradle build, gradle test, and
gradle run commands. Gradle build would inform us if there were any initial
issues with compiling our program. Gradle test was used to see if the actual
output was equal to what we expected. Gradle run also allowed us to visualize
what was being output by our program.

## Dillon's Reflection
This final project was challenging in the sense that we needed to start from
scratch to create a program. We spent a large amount of time on this project
just setting up the basics such as the folders, files, and initialization items
such as public class, packages, and more. Once this was completed, we needed to
research algorithms that did what we needed them to do, which was ciphering. The
research required us to explore many different options of the ciphering, and
took us longer to figure out which one would be best for our case. Additionally,
we had trouble with having multiple main methods in our code. In order to fix this,
we realized that we had to put them all into one file, the Experiment.java file,
and edit the build.gradle settings for our project to ensure the main method was
found and ran correctly based on its new location. Other challenges included
many checkstyle errors, missing brackets, and many other tedious tasks that were
simple yet hard to find. Overall, this final project was more challenging than
last semester, and I feel that is because we had a larger group. It was more
challenging to get everyone together to work on it at the same time, which
resulted in individuals doing large amounts of work alone, or not with the whole
team. A positive from this, however, is that we were able to figure stuff out on
our own, and as a group. We also used the issues tab in GitHub to inform people
who were not in the lab what we had done, and what we had to do still. This was
beneficial to communicating with the whole team, and making sure everyone was on
the same page, even if we were not all together.

## Ben's Reflection
This lab required us to use what we learned in previous labs and apply it to a
new project. We had to design and implement the entire project using our own ideas.
We were able to base most of the lab on previous, but there were many challenges.
Luckily, we used the GitHub tools to create issues for the areas we were struggling
with. This allowed us to keep track of the issues and monitor their status. I also
added TODOs in the areas where I had issues with the program. This allowed my
teammates to see where I thought the source of the problem was originating from.
Another challenge is this lab was that we had very limited access to TAs and
Professor Kapfhammer because the majority of the time we worked on it was during
Finals Week. This made the lab more challenging, but it also made our group need
to think more about the problems and attempt to find a creative solution to get
it to work successfully. Another challenge for this lab was allowing everyone to
meet and work together on this lab. We had a difficult time finding times that
fit everyone's schedule to work on the project together. This led to a large amount
of individual work.

## Robert's Reflection
The fourth paragraph will discuss the third team member's insights.

## Jordan's Reflection
This lab had it's difficulties. It was hard to implement the cipher in our
program because the input for our size was an integer and we were trying to
convert to a string. It was interesting in an topic though because we were able
to figure out how encrypting and decrypting works. The algorithms that we used
for our program were implemented with using simple for loops which I thought
was pretty cool. Overall, this lab challenged us because we took a concept that
we knew a little about but expanded on them. We were able to use time
complexities that we learned from previous labs showed how the two different
ciphers work and how their times differed from each other. I believe I have
learned useful information that I can go on and expand on.
