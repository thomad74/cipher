# Reflection by Dillon Thoma, Ben Watto, Robert Samuel, and Jordan Wilson

## Group Reflection
This lab required us to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
During this project, we learned a lot about the real world application of Computer
Science. Throughout the lab we had many issues involving converting one type of
data to another, to solve this issue we had to change them all to one type to
avoid the errors. We also had to try and implement many different algorithms
before we created one that successful encrypted our messages. To ensure our
program was function correctly, we used the gradle build, gradle test, and gradle
run commands. Gradle build would inform us if there were any initial issues with
compiling our program. Gradle test was used to see if the actual output was equal
to what we expected. Gradle run also allowed us to visualize what was being output
by our program.
