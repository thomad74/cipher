# Reflection by Dillon Thoma, Ben Watto, Robert Samuel, and Jordan Wilson

## Group Reflection
This lab required us to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
During this project, we learned a lot about the real world application of Computer
Science. Throughout the lab we had many issues involving converting one type of
data to another, to solve this issue we had to change them all to one type to
avoid the errors. We also had to try and implement many different algorithms
before we created one that successful encrypted our messages. To ensure our
program was function correctly, we used the gradle build, gradle test, and gradle
run commands. Gradle build would inform us if there were any initial issues with
compiling our program. Gradle test was used to see if the actual output was equal
to what we expected. Gradle run also allowed us to visualize what was being output
by our program.

## Jordan's Reflection
This lab had it's difficulties. It was hard to implement the cipher in our
program because the input for our size was an integer and we were trying to
convert to a string. It was interesting in an topic though because we were able
to figure out how encrypting and decrypting works. The algorithms that we used
for our program were implemented with using simple for loops which I thought
was pretty cool. Overall, this lab challenged us because we took a concept that
we knew a little about but expanded on them. We were able to use time
complexities that we learned from previous labs showed how the two different
ciphers work and how their times differed from each other. I believe I have
learned useful information that I can go on and expand on.
