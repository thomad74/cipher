# Status Update by Dillon Thoma, Ben Watto, Jordan Wilson, & Robert Samuel

For our final project, we have begun the implementation of the initial
cryptography that we will be performing as our main task for the lab. Also,
we have created a results table that will use doubling experiments to evaluate
the algorithm that we use throughout the lab. We have also started to implement
JUnit test cases in our JUnit test suite, and plan to add many more, as well as
fix the formatting. Our goal for this project is to use the cryptography to
encode secret messages, and personalize it someway. We will personalize it by
using an ArrayList that has inputs, perhaps phone numbers or secret text messages,
that are sent secretly and eventually decoded in the output. Also, we will have
the doubling experiments to test which algorithm is the fastest, which is what
is in our Experiment and ResultsTable files. The steps we must take to finish
this assignment are adding more cryptography algorithms, creating more test cases
that tests the correctness of our program, and making sure our code adheres to
the Google Style Guide in the end. We will do this by continuously working as a
team, and meeting multiple times throughout the following week to complete these
tasks, and ultimately the final project.
